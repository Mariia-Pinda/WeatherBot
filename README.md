Since the size of the data file for training the model was too large, we had to put all the program files into an archive.
To run the program, you need to click on the archived file and on ViewRaw. The file will be automatically downloaded to your computer. 
After that, you need to unzip the file and run it as a PyCharm project.

To run the bot, you need to run the main.py file. Then go to Telegram and find https://t.me/pgsadjfnogifndogkdas_bot. 
When the main.py file is running, select \start in the bot menu. The bot will ask for the location, enter the location, press Enter. The bot provides forecasts and useful tips.

Main components: the model_training.ipynb file, where data is processed and the model is trained, and the results are saved;
main.py file for creating a forecast and useful tips;
data folder with Kyiv data for model training and saved data after training.
